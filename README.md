---

## Installation

**Pre-Requisites**

The `zm-mailbox` project must be built and deployed to the `.zcs-deps` folder.

The `zm-build` and `zm-zcs` projects should also reside in the same local parent folder as this project.


**Deploying the extension from CLI**
Test deploy 2 jars
For testing purposes you can build and deploy the extension to `/opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zm-oauth-social` by running the following:

```sh
ant deploy
```

Afterwards, configure ldap and localconfig as necessary, then become the `zimbra` user, and perform a `zmmailboxdctl restart`.

**Testing from CLI**

```sh
ant test
```

## Usage

**API**

See the [documentation for api usage].

After a user completes the oauth2 flow, the credentials for their account will be stored as a data source with a configured folder created in the user's root mailbox during authentication. The import is triggered after successful completion of the OAuth flow. An import can also be triggered manually with a `zmsoap` import data request.

**Resources**

| Path | Description | Response Type |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `/service/extension/oauth2/authorize/{client}?type={type}` | Initiates the oauth2 flow with a redirect response. Type is one of `contact`, `calendar`, `caldav` or `noop` see: OAuth2DataSource.java.  | HTTP Redirect |
| `/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/{client}` | Callback url for the social service in the oauth2 flow | HTTP Redirect |
| `/service/extension/oauth2/refresh/{client}/{identifier}` | Acquires and returns a new access token for the identified social account (limited support) | JSON |
| `/service/extension/oauth2/info/{client}` | Returns info for the specified client | JSON |
| `/service/extension/oauth2/event/{client}` | This is currently only used by Zoom for deauthorization | 202 Accepted |
| `/service/extension/oauth2-proxy/{client}?target={target}` | Similar to the Zimlet ProxyServlet, attaches configured Authorization header for the specified client. | Varies, JSON on error |
